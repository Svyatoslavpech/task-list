# ✅ Task List — Task Management & Data Persistence App

A lightweight, product-focused task management web application built to demonstrate **reliability, data consistency, and user-centered UI behavior**.  
Designed with a **QA and production mindset**, emphasizing predictable state management and data persistence.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Task List** allows users to create, manage, and track tasks through a clean and intuitive interface.  
The project focuses not on feature overload, but on **correctness, validation, and data integrity**, ensuring tasks persist reliably across browser sessions.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ➕ Create, edit, and delete tasks (full CRUD)
- ✅ Input validation to prevent empty or invalid entries
- 💾 Persistent data storage using **LocalStorage**
- 🔄 Automatic task recovery on page reload
- 🧭 Clean, predictable UI behavior
- 🛡️ Edge-case handling for user input and data state

---

## 🧠 Product & QA Mindset

This project was built with **production readiness** in mind:

- **Reliability:** Tasks persist without loss or corruption  
- **Usability:** Simple interaction flows and clear feedback  
- **Consistency:** Controlled state changes and predictable UI updates  
- **Risk Reduction:** Validation and defensive logic against user errors  

These principles mirror real-world requirements in **QA, frontend, and AI product support roles**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — application logic and state handling  
- **HTML** — structure  
- **CSS** — layout and styling  
- **Browser LocalStorage** — client-side data persistence  

---

## 🔄 How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. User enters a task  
2. Input is validated before creation  
3. Task is stored in LocalStorage  
4. On page reload, tasks are restored from storage  
5. UI reflects the current, consistent state  

This approach ensures **data integrity and predictable behavior**.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Although simple in scope, **Task List** demonstrates skills essential for junior engineering roles:

- Attention to **edge cases and validation**
- Understanding of **state and data persistence**
- Product-oriented thinking beyond “happy path” solutions
- Clean and maintainable frontend logic

---

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements

- Automated unit or UI tests  
- Task prioritization and filtering  
- Backend persistence (API + database)  
- Error monitoring and logging

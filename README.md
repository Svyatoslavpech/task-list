# Task-List

✅ Task List — Task Management & Data Persistence App

A lightweight task management web application focused on data reliability, clean UI behavior, and predictable user interactions.
Built to demonstrate production-minded frontend development with attention to validation, persistence, and edge cases.

🔍 Overview

Task List allows users to create, manage, and track tasks in a simple, intuitive interface.
Unlike basic demos, this project emphasizes state consistency and data persistence, ensuring tasks are not lost between browser sessions.

✨ Key Features

➕ Create, edit, and delete tasks (full CRUD)

✅ Input validation to prevent empty or invalid entries

💾 Persistent data storage using LocalStorage

🔄 Automatic state recovery on page reload

🧭 Clean and intuitive UI with predictable behavior

🛡️ Edge-case handling for user input and data state

🧠 Product & Engineering Focus

This project was designed with a QA and product mindset, not just feature delivery:

Reliability: Tasks persist across sessions without data corruption

Usability: Clear visual feedback and simple interaction flows

Maintainability: Structured JavaScript logic and readable code

Risk Reduction: Validation and controlled state changes prevent inconsistent UI states

🛠️ Tech Stack

JavaScript (Vanilla) — application logic and state handling

HTML / CSS — layout and styling

Browser LocalStorage — client-side data persistence

📂 How It Works (High-Level)

User inputs a task

Input is validated before creation

Task is saved to LocalStorage

On page load, tasks are restored from storage

UI updates reflect the current, consistent state

This flow mirrors real-world frontend reliability requirements where user data must not be lost or corrupted.

🎯 Why This Project Matters

While simple on the surface, Task List demonstrates core skills relevant to QA, frontend, and AI product support roles:

Attention to edge cases and user errors

Understanding of state management and persistence

Product-oriented thinking beyond “happy paths”

Clean separation between UI and logic

🚀 Possible Extensions

Automated UI or unit tests

Task prioritization and filtering

Backend persistence (API + database)

Error monitoring and logging
